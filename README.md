# Early Access 0.9.8

**Eccirian Encrypt** is a security-focused Obsidian plugin which provides seamless file encryption. The plugin adds file-level encryption and decryption capabilities to your vault, using AES-256-GCM and ECC-P-256 cryptographic encryption algorithms. By introduces custom file extensions and read-only view for locked files, allowing you to easily manage sensitive information directly in Obsidian. It is also the only plugin that supports one-click encryption of all link attachments.

## Why Eccirian?

### Attachment Encryption
Unlike other encryption plugins that only encrypt note content, Eccirian can **encrypt your attachments** (images, PDFs, documents) alongside your notes.

### Lightning Fast
Zero performance overhead. Encryption and decryption both utilize the browser's native Web Crypto API `crypto.subtle` for hardware-accelerated AES-GCM operations. Key derivation meets OWASP's minimum security requirements without sacrificing speed by useing the `PBKDF2` algorithm.

### Flexible Mode Switching
- **Temporary Mode** (`.eccirian`) - One-time password, auto-decrypt on open
- **Permanent Mode** (`.peccirian`) - Persistent encryption, password are required every time

### **Maximum Security**
- **AES-256-GCM** - Industry standard symmetric encryption
- **ECC + AES** - Hybrid encryption for maximum security

## Security & Encryption Algorithms

**1. AES-256-GCM (Default)**
 - 256-bit key length
 - Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for authenticated encryption
 - PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
 - SHA-256 hash function
 - 16-byte random salt per encryption
 - 12-byte initialization vector (IV)

**2. ECC + AES (Advanced)**

 - P-256 elliptic curve (secp256r1)
 - ECDH key exchange for key agreement
 - Combined with AES-256-GCM for data encryption
 - Same PBKDF2 parameters as AES method

In addition:

- **Password Protection** - Passwords are never saved anywhere
- **Unique Salts** - Each encryption uses a fresh random salt
- **Authenticated Encryption** - GCM mode prevents tampering
- **Memory-only Decryption** - Permanent mode files stay encrypted on disk

## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: [Community Plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=eccirian#) (Recommended) 

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go **Community Plugins** ‚Üí **Browse**
3. Search for "**Eccirian Encrypt**"
4. Click **Install** ‚Üí **Enable**

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release `release.zip` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Enthalpiex/eccirian-encrypt/releases)
2. Extract the files to your vault's plugin directory:
   ```
   <your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/eccirian-encrypt/
   ```
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable the plugin in **Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic

**Temporary Mode** (Auto-decrypt on open)
1. Open any note
2. Click the lock icon in the ribbon, or use `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Encrypt/Decrypt file"
3. Enter a password
4. Your note encrypted as `.eccirian`
5. Click "Unlock" to decrypt back to `.md`

**Permanent Mode** (Always encrypted)
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Eccirian Encrypt**
2. Set **Default Encryption Mode** to "Permanent"
3. Encrypt a note (same steps as above)
4. File becomes `.peccirian` and requires password every time you open it


### Commands

**Convert to Markdown**
- Converts `.peccirian` files to regular `.md` files
- Use: `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Convert to Markdown"
- Or click the convert icon in the ribbon

**Toggle File Extension**
- Force conversion between `.md` and `.eccirian` extensions
- Useful for creating encrypted views or fixing extension issues
- Use: `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Toggle file Extension"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This plugin is designed for **personal use** and **reasonable security needs**
- **Not recommended** for highly classified or mission-critical information
- **Always backup** your vault before encrypting important files
- **Remember your passwords** and there is **NO** recovery mechanism
- The developer is not responsible for **any data loss**

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**  
A: Unfortunately, there's no way to recover encrypted data without the password. This is by design for security.

**Q: Can I use this with Sync?**  
A: Yes. Encrypted files sync perfectly across devices. [Remotely Save](https://github.com/Enthalpiex/eccirian-encrypt/releaseshttps://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) is a great plugin to do this.

**Q: Does attachment encryption work with Permanent mode?**  
A: Currently only Temporary mode supports attachment encryption. Permanent mode support is coming in a future release.

**Q: Are my passwords stored anywhere?**  
A: No. Passwords are never stored. They're only used during encryption/decryption and immediately discarded.

**Q: Can I encrypt folders?**  
A: Not yet; but this feature is planned for a future release.
