- ‚ö° **Low performance overhead** ‚Äî encryption and decryption happen instantly with no noticeable lag.
- üß© **Optional composite encryption methods** ‚Äî choose your level of security.
- üîÅ **Flexible mode switching** ‚Äî choose between temporary or permanent encryption.
- üñºÔ∏è **Full compatibility** with `Hover Editor` and `Page Preview` ‚Äî thanks to the locked page view, you won't get annoying popups on hover.
- üñãÔ∏è **Customizable locked page** ‚Äî personalize the locked view message and appearance.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Minimal interference with workflow** ‚Äî locked files integrate cleanly into your vault without breaking navigation or previews.

##  Security

1. **AES-256-GCM**
   - 256-bit key length
   - Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for authenticated encryption
   - PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
   - SHA-256 hash function
   - 16-byte random salt
   - 12-byte initialization vector (IV)

2. **ECC+AES**
   - P-256 curve (secp256r1)
   - ECDH key exchange
   - Combined with AES-GCM for data encryption
   - Same PBKDF2 parameters as AES method

- **Password Protection**: Passwords are never stored in any form.
- **Decryption**: For the permanently encrypted files you set, they will never be automatically decrypted to the hard disk unless you allow them to be.
- **Salt Protection**: Unique salt for each encryption prevents rainbow table attacks.

2. Run the `eccirian Encrypt: Encrypt/Decrypt Note` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P`) or click left icon.
3. Enter a password to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Encrypted files will be renamed to `.eccirian` or `.peccirian`and shown as locked views.
5. Click ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù and enter the password to decrypt and return to edit mode.

## Others 

6. Run the `eccirian Encrypt: Convert to Markdown` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P`) or click left icon to decrypt the peccirian file into a normal file.
7. Run the `eccirian Encrypt: Toggle file Extension` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P`) or click left icon to force conversion between md and eccirian files, or create fake encrypted views.

##  Security Notes

- The plugin is designed for personal use and basic security needs.
- Do not use it for storing highly sensitive or critical information.
- The developer is not responsible for any loss of encrypted data.
- If you forget your password, there is no way to recover the encrypted data.
